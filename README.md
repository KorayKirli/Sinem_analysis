# Template for a Jupyter Notebook repo to use with Binder

When you share a Jupyter notebook (or any script) that depends on other libraries, the receiving party often needs some setup. This server, called Binder, can take any Github repo and turn it into an online Jupyter notebook. Behind the scenes, it creates a docker with your packages. On your github repo you need some minimal setup, and I prepared a very simple version as an example. You can also share the binder version of your repo as a link. The website is https://mybinder.org/.
